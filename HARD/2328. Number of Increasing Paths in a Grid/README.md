# Question
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all `4` directions.

Return the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that you can start from any cell and end at any cell. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.

[2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid/)

# Intuition
Use DFS to count the number of strictly increasing paths in a given m x n integer matrix grid.


# Approach
The code you provided implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to count the number of strictly increasing paths in a given m x n integer matrix grid. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a 2D array `paths_ending_at_cell` to store the number of strictly increasing paths ending at each cell in the grid.
2. Define a recursive function `dfs` that takes two arguments: the row and column index of the current cell.
3. The `dfs` function first checks if the `paths_ending_at_cell` array already contains a value for the current cell. If it does, then the function simply returns that value.
4. Otherwise, the `dfs` function calculates the number of strictly increasing paths ending at the current cell as follows:
    * For each of the four adjacent cells of the current cell, if the value of the adjacent cell is strictly less than the value of the current cell, then the `dfs` function adds the number of strictly increasing paths ending at the adjacent cell to the count of strictly increasing paths ending at the current cell.
    * The `dfs` function then stores the count of strictly increasing paths ending at the current cell in the `paths_ending_at_cell` array.
    * The `dfs` function finally returns the count of strictly increasing paths ending at the current cell.
5. The main function calls the `dfs` function for each cell in the grid.
6. The main function then sums the values in the `paths_ending_at_cell` array and returns the result, modulo 10^9 + 7.

The `dfs` function uses memoization to avoid re-calculating the number of strictly increasing paths ending at a given cell multiple times. Memoization is a technique that stores the results of expensive computations in a table so that they can be looked up quickly when needed again. In this case, the expensive computation is the calculation of the number of strictly increasing paths ending at a given cell. The `paths_ending_at_cell` array is used as the memoization table.

The `dfs` function also uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is always less than or equal to 10^9 + 7. This is necessary because the number of strictly increasing paths ending at a given cell can be very large.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m^2 * n^2)$$
The time complexity of the code for the given question is O(m^2 * n^2).

The outer loop iterates over all rows in the grid, and the inner loop iterates over all columns in the grid. For each cell, the `dfs()` function recursively explores all possible paths that start at that cell. The `dfs()` function has a time complexity of O(m + n), because it needs to check all of the neighboring cells. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(m<sup>2</sup> * n<sup>2</sup>).

Here is a more detailed explanation of the time complexity:

* The outer loop iterates over all rows in the grid. This takes O(m) time.
* The inner loop iterates over all columns in the grid. This also takes O(n) time.
* The `dfs()` function recursively explores all possible paths that start at a given cell. This takes O(m + n) time.
* The `dfs()` function is called once for each cell in the grid. Therefore, the total time spent in the `dfs()` function is O(m * n).
* The total time spent in the outer and inner loops is O(m + n).
* The total time complexity of the code is O(m<sup>2</sup> * n<sup>2</sup>).

In practice, the time complexity of the code may be less than O(m<sup>2</sup> * n<sup>2</sup>), because the `dfs()` function may not need to explore all possible paths. However, the worst-case time complexity is O(m<sup>2</sup> * n<sup>2</sup>).


- Space complexity:$$O(mn)$$
The space complexity of the code for the given question is O(mn). This is because the algorithm uses a 2D array `paths_ending_at_cell` to store the number of strictly increasing paths ending at each cell. The size of this array is `m * n`, which is the same as the size of the input matrix `grid`.

The algorithm could be made to have a space complexity of O(1) by using a recursive approach. In this approach, the algorithm would only need to store the current row and column index, as well as the number of strictly increasing paths ending at the current cell. However, this approach would have a time complexity of O(m!n!), which is much slower than the current approach.

Here is a table that summarizes the time and space complexities of the two approaches:

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Iterative | O(mn) | O(mn) |
| Recursive | O(m!n!) | O(1) |

The iterative approach is a better choice for most problems, as it is both faster and uses less memory. However, the recursive approach may be a better choice for problems where the time complexity is not a concern.
