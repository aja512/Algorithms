# Question
You are given a positive integer ```n``` which is the number of nodes of a 0-indexed undirected weighted connected graph and a 0-indexed 2D array ```edges``` where ```edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]``` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ```ui``` and ```vi``` with weight ```wi```.

You are also given two nodes ```s``` and ```d```, and a positive integer ```k```, your task is to find the shortest path from ```s``` to ```d```, but you can hop over at most ```k``` edges. 
In other words, make the weight of at most ```k``` edges 0 and then find the shortest path from ```s``` to ```d```.

Return the length of the shortest path from ```s``` to ```d``` with the given condition.
